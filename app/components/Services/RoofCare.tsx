          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Roof leaks can be caused by various factors including storm damage from hail, tree damage from falling limbs, foot traffic, old worn out shingles, and sun damage. However, 90% of all roof leaks are caused by improper installation or defective metal flashing. Rarely does the actual roofing product fail. Flashing is found near any roof penetration area such as chimneys, step, apron, and valleys where roof angles join together. During a roof repair, it is crucial to inspect for any other damage that could lead to additional problems. If leaks are not addressed, the structure of your home may be weakened as the building frame continues to be exposed to dampness.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Poor installation of roof shingles, which are sometimes nailed incorrectly, may also need to be addressed. If roof shingles are missing, they will need to be replaced promptly.
